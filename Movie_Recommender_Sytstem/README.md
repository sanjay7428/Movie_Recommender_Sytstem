# movie-recommender-system-tmdb-dataset
A content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity
Here is the content formatted for a `README.md` file for your GitHub project:

```markdown
# Movie Recommender System

This repository contains a Movie Recommender System built using collaborative filtering techniques.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tisha729/Movie_Recommender_Sytstem
```

### 2. Generate the `similarity.pkl` file
To generate the `similarity.pkl` file, you need to run the `project.ipynb` notebook. This will create the `similarity.pkl` file required for the recommendation system to function.

```bash
# Open project.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute all cells to create similarity.pkl
```

### 3. Install dependencies for the Frontend
For the frontend, we use Streamlit. To install Streamlit, run the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

### 4. Running the Frontend
Once Streamlit is installed, you can run the frontend by executing:

```bash
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit app in your browser, and you can interact with the movie recommender system.
```

You can copy and paste this directly into your `README.md` file on GitHub.
